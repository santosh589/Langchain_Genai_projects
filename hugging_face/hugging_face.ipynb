       "\"What is the health insurance coverage?\\n\\nHealth insurance coverage is a type of insurance that helps pay for medical expenses, such as doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription drugs. It can also cover preventive care, such as vaccinations and screenings. Health insurance can be provided by an employer, purchased individually, or obtained through a government program, such as Medicare or Medicaid.\\n\\nThere are different types of health insurance plans, including HMOs, PPOs, and high-deductible health plans. Each type of plan has its own set of benefits, costs, and restrictions. It's important to understand the details of a health insurance plan before enrolling to ensure that it meets your needs and budget.\\n\\nHealth insurance is important because medical care can be expensive, and without insurance, many people would not be able to afford the care they need. Having health insurance can help protect you from financial hardship in the event of an unexpected illness or injury. It can also provide peace of mind, knowing that you have access to the care you need when you need it.\""

      "Explanation:\n",
      "The question asks for changes in public coverage by state from 2021 to 2022. The context provides information about the changes in public health insurance coverage for 13 states that saw increases and one state, Rhode Island, that had a decrease. The changes ranged from 0.6 percentage points to 2.3 percentage points across states. Rhode Island reported a decrease of 2.2 percentage points, which was driven by a decrease in people reporting Medicaid (2.3 percentage points). Therefore, the answer to the question is that 13 states saw increases in public coverage, while Rhode Island saw a decrease.\n"
